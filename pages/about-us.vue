        <p>The Heist is an innovative NFT Collection</p>
        <p>
          The Heist Group consists of 3 women who find themselves at a
          crossroad. A drunk and impulsive night turned into risking everything
          they have and moving across the country in an attempt to change their
          lives. Little did they know how much their lives would actually
          change. Between terrible decisions and awful money management they
          find themselves having to choose between options.. Continuing down the
          straight and narrow path, or getting into a life of crime. The choice
          is made for them when they accidentally (but almost by choice) kill a
          friend’s A$$hole boyfriend. After this horrific incident- there is no
          turning back.
        </p>
        <p>
          They start to plot and scheme their way into New York, robbing several
          gas stations and eventually a bank on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The papers... ugh... the papers! They never seem to get it right. Some
          say that they wear masks because they are hiding something, others say
          they wear wigs and a bare face. OH! The horror- for who would believe
          3 gorgeous 20 year old women would cause such a ruckus.
        </p>
        <p>
          They breeze through the small towns unnoticed and uncaptured. Leaving
          nothing behind but a trail of empty cash registers and male bank
          tellers who piss their pants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once they arrive in New York they lay low, they try to get normal jobs
          and do normal things. But let's be honest- once you get a taste of the
          pie, you can never say no. And their stomachs are hungry, more hungry
          for bigger and better things, FASTER!- I mean, isn’t that what New
          York does to everyone?
        </p>
        <p>
          They hit Atlantic City to hide all of the money they've collected...
          This is where The Heist Group was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          A committee of all women that broke free from the rules of society,
          from poverty, and the strict laws of their Government.
        </p>
        <p>
          They created a union of 10,000 ruthless female trained escape artists,
          specialized in Heist Missions against this system. Spectators seem to
          only catch but a glimpse of the crimes they commit. Sly, prestigious
          but executing their plans precisely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some say that thousands of them are all dressed in different attire
          when seen in person, others think it is the same 3 girls doing it all.
          Legend has it, by the time the local authorities are to be contacted
          for help, a cloud of dust is seen out of the building. Some have ideas
          of what they look like, and others say it is all a myth. Not only are
          these women professional bank robbers, jewelry thieves, and hijackers
          on a block chain, they plan to expand inside of the METAVERSE It is
          believed they run the largest Crime Union on the Western Hemisphere
          called the Heist Group and they are looking for expansion!
        </p>
        <p>But like they say in the Papers- “It may all just be a myth”</p>
        <p>xo,</p>
